# Randomly pick a Playing Card (only one suit)
## You can approach this two ways:
### Just pick a card and filter after the fact
### OR
### Shuffle the deck so to speak and just "deal" the next one

# Enumerate values to Playing Card values
## Enumeration allows you to change one value into another directly.
## So the 1 is actually called Ace, 2-10 are face value, 11 is Jack, 12 is Queen and 13 is King

# Store first pick

# Print picks
## Function this

# Ask for higher or lower
## If it picks a previous card reject it and pick again

# Print picks

# Print a message about their guess
