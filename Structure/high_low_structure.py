# Part 1 - Generate random number from 1 - 13
## You can generate any numbers as long as they relate to 1-13. 
# Part 1 - Enumerate Playing Card values to numbers generated
## Enumeration allows you to change one value into another directly.
## So the 1 of Spades is actually called Ace of Spades, 2-10 are face value, 11 is Jack, 12 is Queen and 13 is King
## This is where the number generation goes from 1-13 to Playing Card values
# Part 1 - Print Playing Card Value not the number (unless it is the face value for 2-10)
# Part 2 - Prompt user to guess whether the next card will be higher or lower.
## If the card is equal the guess is incorrect
# Part 2 - Display the second card
## This should show the previous card too for context
# Part 2 - Display appropriate message based upon guess accuracy
